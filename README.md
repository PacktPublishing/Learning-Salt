## About the Video Course
SaltStack automates the management and configuration of any infrastructure or application at scale. It provides an arsenal of tools to execute commands across thousands of systems with ease. 

Learning Saltstack will start from scratch and build towards a high-level goal of installing, configuring, deploying, and managing a web application to Docker containers across multiple systems behind a HAProxy load balancer. The course will start by explaining how Salt approaches System management and help the viewer get up and running with a working Salt infrastructure. You will learn how to use Salt to target, query, and change systems. 

You will learn to define the desired state of your infrastrucrture and how you can use Salt to enforce the state with a single command. The course will dive deeper into YAML and Jinja and show you the best practices for writing reusable and maintainable states. Finally, you will learn about some of the additional tools that salt provides, including salt-cloud, the reactor, and the event system. 

By the end of the course, you would be able to build and manage your infrastructure and fully utilize its potential.
